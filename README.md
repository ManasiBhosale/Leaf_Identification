## 📝 Project Overview

When you land on the site, a **random plant or tree fact** pops up to spark your curiosity. Then you can:

- **Snap** a live photo of a leaf (via your camera)  
- **Upload** a saved image  

Behind the scenes, a CNN trained on 1,625 leaf images across **10 species** (with 99% train, 94% val, 95% test accuracies) classifies your leaf. You’ll see:

- **Botanical Name** & Other Names  
- **Medicinal Uses**  
- **Known Locations** (interactive maps powered by Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap)  

Plus, you can **save favorites** in your personal Collection—so you never have to re-upload the same leaf twice.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- `virtualenv` or `venv`  
- Folders:  
  - `uploads/` (for incoming leaf images)  
  - `collect/` (to save favorites)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManasiBhosale/Leaf_Identification.git
   cd Leaf_Identification
   ```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create needed folders**  
   ```bash
   # Create the necessary folders
   mkdir uploads               # Folder for uploaded images
   mkdir static/images/collect  # Folder for favorite images & data

   ```

5. **Run the app**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Then open: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
